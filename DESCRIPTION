Description: Solves system of linear equations using (preconditioned) conjugate gradient algorithm, with improved efficiency and flexibility for user-specified preconditioning method. To improve scalability of conjugate gradient methods for larger matrices, the Armadillo templated C++ linear algebra library is used for the implementation. The package also provides flexibility to have user-specified preconditioner options to cater for different optimization needs.
